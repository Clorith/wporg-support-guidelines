## Helping Out

To assist people who wish to help others, a list of unanswered topics can be found in the “[No Replies](https://wordpress.org/support/view/no-replies)” link at the bottom of the front page. That page is often used by folks to find questions to answer next.

We do not expect everyone to know everything. Questions should be answered as fully as possible, with as much respect for humanity as possible. It is not a place for self promotion, solicitations, or to have a private conversation.

The point of helping others via WordPress.org forums is to help building a knowledge base for everyone. Remember, we don’t want [this](https://xkcd.com/979/) to happen. Leave something for the next person who has the same problem. If you link to more information, make sure to still include the most important details directly in your answer, since the link you give may not be valid a couple of years later.
