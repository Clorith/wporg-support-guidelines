## Reporting Threads (Modlook)

To bring a post to the attention of the moderators, add a tag called ‘modlook’ to the thread by clicking the “Report” button. The moderating team will then have a look at the topic.

The modlook tag is **only for reporting issues with the forum itself**. Using this tag in the hopes of attracting the attention of a moderator to a support question to get it answered faster is considered abuse.

Use this function on things like spam, people using signatures in their posts, or duplicate threads. Things that a forum moderator should see and correct.
