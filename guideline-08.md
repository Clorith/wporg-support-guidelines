## The Bad Stuff...

We need to keep the forums friendly, so, occasionally, topic content will be moderated. In severe cases, users may be blocked. This might mean anything from the light editing of some posts to complete removal of topics and deactivation of accounts. It should really go without saying, but the following are likely candidates for moderation or intervention

- Do not post email addresses, ask others to post their email or solicit contacting people off of the forums.
- Do not post login information, even test IDs and test passwords.
- Do not post simply to request feedback on their site.
- Do not post another person’s private information (job, gender, living situation, location, etc).
- Do not ask for any kind of access in order to provide support, not even for plugins or themes.
- Do not harass or abuse people. Do not go to their websites, do not pick out their home addresses, phone numbers, Twitter ID, Skype ID, Facebook, any social media accounts or ways to contact them and use it to ask for support. Only use contact methods explicitly given.
- Do not abuse the 'Report this topic' or 'modlook' system.
- Do not post spam and affiliate links, offensive posts, posts without content, or flames.
- Do not post in all caps.
- Do not ask for help regarding premium themes/plugins.
- Do not abuse the `@<name>` mentions, they are not a tool to get faster responses.
- Do not seek legal advice on the forums: We are not lawyers, and if we were we would then open our selves to liabilities.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive. Every post is judged on its own merits.

And that’s all. Enjoy your stay at the forums! Oh.. And, when you’re done, please mark your topic as “Resolved”. Thanks.
