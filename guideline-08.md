## Do Not Open Multiple Accounts (Sockpuppets)

Do not open multiple accounts, aka [sockpuppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)). Sockpuppetry is often used for nefarious reasons, and as such we ask that you simply don’t do it. If a sockpuppet account is identified, it will be [banned](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/forum-welcome/#being-mod-watched-or-banned) immediately.

If you are a plugin or theme developer, or a representative of a company involved with WordPress in some way (like a hosting provider), having separate personal and “business” accounts is acceptable, we don’t consider that to be sockpuppetry.
