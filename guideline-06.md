## Link to The Site

If a question relates to a specific site or page, and the site is publicly viewable, provide a link. This will allow people to see the issue and often leads to faster resolutions.

The forum is not designed to be a link portal; excessive linkage will be moderated, as will signatures or links with no associated question.

**Links will *not* get removed any time later, unless in extreme circumstances.** Google will capture links, so if that is a concern, please donâ€™t link.
