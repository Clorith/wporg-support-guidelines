## Deleting / Editing Reviews

Plugin and theme reviews are rarely deleted unless the posts are determined to be made by sockpuppets or harassers.

In general, reviews will not be deleted because they are negative. A review is someoneâ€™s experience with a product, be it good or bad. It is the responsibility of the developer to reply and handle complaints as an adult.

Reputation is impacted more by how a person handles complaints versus how they are treated by users.
