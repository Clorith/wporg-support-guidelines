## Deleting Accounts

Accounts cannot be deleted, not even for obvious spammers, due to technical limitations of the system.

Usernames cannot be changed either. To use different username, create the new username and stop using the old one.

There are many systems that your forum account hooks into: support forums, make blogs, core SVN, plugins SVN, theme SVN, meta SVN, and so on and so forth. It’s a technical mess and we know it’s annoying when someone wants to walk away, or regrets the unprofessional username cocopuff77, but it’s just what we’ve got right now.
