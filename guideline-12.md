## Posting Large Excerpt of Code

When a large amount of code needs to be posted, it can make a thread difficult to read. If, for example, an entire php, css, or JS file needs to be posted, it should be posted on a service such as [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and linked in the post.

As for what constitutes a large excerpt, itâ€™s difficult to say. It is generally easier to read a pastebin/gist than a styled block of 150 lines of multi-indented code. Scrolling back and forth, as well as up and down, trying to unpick code via a cramped code box is a time-consuming activity that distracts from answering the actual questions.
