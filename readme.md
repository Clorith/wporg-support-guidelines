# WordPress Support Forums/IRC Guidelines

This is the online repository for keeping the WordPress.org Support Guidelines up to date.

The original set of guidelines in this repository are based on the ones used as of October 12th, 2018.

## Feedback

All feedback is welcome, you may provide suggestions on improvements either through [issues](https://github.com/Clorith/wporg-support-guidelines/issues/new), or as [Pull Request](https://github.com/Clorith/wporg-support-guidelines/compare). 

Discussion points should be opened as new issues, or be covered in the `#forums` channel on the Making WordPress Slack. 
Any discussions happening on Slack should also be summarised in a ticket here.

## Goal

The goal is to provide a streamlined set of guidelines for users to read. We have the power of Gutenberg to help make the UI more engaging.

We should also re-evaluate any longer items that are hard to understand, and try to condense them into other elements.
Should this not prove possible, summarising them and providing a separate sub-page for in-depth explanations may be considered as an alternative for those wanting a better explanation.

The idea of creating a visually easy, and less wordy guideline was encouraged by the [2018 update to the StackExchange Code of Conduct](https://meta.stackexchange.com/conduct), which made them much more pleasant to read and easier to understand.
