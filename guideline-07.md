## Do Not Post About Commercial Products

For support of commercial themes or plugins, please use their official support channels.

In order to be good stewards of the WordPress community, and encourage innovation and progress, we feel it’s important to direct people to those official locations. Doing this will provide the developer with the income they need to make WordPress awesome.

Keep in mind that forum volunteers don’t have access to commercial products, so they would not be able to study the code of a commercial theme or plugin to figure out why it is not working properly.

Ultimately, the vendors are responsible for supporting their commercial product.
