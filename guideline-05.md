## Include as Much Information as Possible

Include details about the hosting environment, WordPress install (plugins, themes, etc.), and the problem being faced when posting a topic.

If there are errors, copy them word for word into the post. It’s best to include the full error than to summarize – sometimes wording is important. If a plugin was activated or a setting changed immediately before the error occurred, mention that and, if possible, exactly what steps were taken.

While screenshots cannot be uploaded, they can be linked to from places like [CloudUp](https://cloudup.com/).
