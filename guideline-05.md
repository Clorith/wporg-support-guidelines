## Do Not Offer to Work For Hire

Donâ€™t offer to work for hire in replies on these forums. Help on the forums should be given freely, as in beer.

The [WP Jobs](http://jobs.wordpress.net/) board is available for those seeking to find jobs.

We believe that people should be able to make a living based on WordPress, but the support forums are not the appropriate place for that.
