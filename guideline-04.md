## Do Not Bump Posts

Do not [bump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Bumping) posts.

Many volunteers use the [list of threads without replies](https://wordpress.org/support/view/no-replies) to find suitable questions to answer. When a post is bumped, it disappears from this list, something that may actually lower your chances of getting appropriate help. 

Moderators will delete bumps when they see them. This is in order to help posts get back into the No Replies listing, where they are more likely to get an answer.
