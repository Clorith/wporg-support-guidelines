## Tag Topics Wisely

Tags are a great way to help others find related support requests, and to help developers keep track of specific features.

Be considerate of this when tagging topics. The tag “REST API” would be a great for a topic about the REST API, while “rest” is common and largely unrelated English word and therefore not a great tag choice. Avoid very general tags, like “WordPress” and “problem.” Searching first is a great way to see what tags are being used by others with similar problems.

Tags should be separated by commas.
