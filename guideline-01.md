## Search Before Posting

Many of the questions that are posted in the forums have been posted many times before, and get the same answers each time. Before starting a new thread, search the forums for an answer. All of WordPress.org has been indexed by [Google](http://www.google.com/), so if a forum search doesnâ€™t result in answers, check in Google too (e.g. Google for [site:wordpress.org/support widget](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Awordpress.org%2Fsupport%20widget&gws_rd=ssl)).

If the only topics are similar, but not exact, do not post in that topic to ask for help.
