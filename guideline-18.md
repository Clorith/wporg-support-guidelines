## Helping Out

To assist people who wish to help others, a list of unanswered topics can be found in the “[No Replies](https://wordpress.org/support/view/no-replies)” link at the bottom of the front page. That page is often used by folks to find questions to answer next. This is also a good reason why nobody should bump their topics. Bumping is discouraged and bumps may be deleted by the moderators.

We do not expect everyone to know everything. Questions should be answered as fully as possible, with as much respect for humanity as possible. It is not a place for self promotion, solicitations, or to have a private conversation.

The point of helping out on the WordPress.org forums is to help out on the forums for everyone. Remember, we don’t want [this](http://xkcd.com/979/) to happen. Leave something for the next person who has the same problem.
