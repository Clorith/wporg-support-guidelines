## Forum Chat

The `#forums` channel on [slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) is available for anyone to come and post questions about handling questions on the forums, or about moderator.

The channel is for discussing issues with the support forum itself, not posting about specific problems with WordPress. Itâ€™s primarily used by forum moderators and other regular volunteers for discussion of code and behavioral issues on the forums.
