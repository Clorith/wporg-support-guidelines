## Being 'Mod Watched' or Banned

The following message will appear if posts are caught as potential spam, or if an account has been flagged to require moderation:

> This post has been held for moderation by our automated system. It will be reviewed within 72 hours.

Accounts are set to be moderated when the poster has a pattern of behavior that is questionable. For example, someone may be moderated for posting with their signature in a post multiple times, after being asked to stop. Or as another example, an account may be moderated if vulgarities are used.

Flagging an account to be moderated is a cool-down tactic used to allow the account to be monitored while still permitting the poster to participate on the forums. It just means the poster’s behavior caught our attention in a slightly negative way, and we want to keep an eye on them.

If this happens, please be patient. We review and approve all posts quickly, or edit them and reply, pointing out what’s wrong.

If actions escalate, users will be banned. There’s no one specific behavior to point at for this, but essentially if the poster starts lashing out, calling people names, making accusations, emailing people nasty messages, or challenging the authority of the moderators, they will be banned.

Don’t act like a bad person. We expect all posters to behave like adults. If this is impossible then they will not be permitted to post on the forums. Attempting to circumvent a ban will result in a perma-ban.

Harassing *anyone* via WordPress.org is not permitted, and violates will be banned from all aspects of WordPress.org, including plugins, themes, make blogs, and trac.
