## Contacting the Moderators

If a post needs moderator attention, use the tag `modlook` by hitting the “Report” button.

If moderator help is needed in a different manner, the `#forums` channel is available in [slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).

Following moderators 'home' and sending them unsolicited email is harassment. Moderators are people too and name calling because they won’t delete a post (or did delete one) is not welcome.

Threatening legal actions against moderators is a sure way to get yourself banned from the forums.
