## Post In the Best Place

The forum is split into sections, with each forum having its own one-line description on the front page.

Choose the most suitable section for a new topic and post in only one section. Duplicate posts will be removed.

Unless users have the exact same version of WordPress on the same physical server hosted by the same hosts with the same plugins, theme, and configurations, then the odds are the solution for one user will not be the same for another. For this reason, we recommend people start their own topics.

Choose the most appropriate section from the [forum front page](https://wordpress.org/support/). Start a new topic by clicking the “Add New »” button to the right of the section’s title.

To post support questions for specific themes or plugins, visit the WordPress.org directory page for the theme/plugin first and click on the support link to create a post. This will make it more visible to the author and making it more clear what the post is about.
